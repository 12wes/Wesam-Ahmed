                On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet,
                 the iPad.[306][307] It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats 
                 including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, 
                 video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch screen.[308] It also includes 
                 a mobile version of Safari for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, 
                 iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts, and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi 
                 and optional 3G service or synced through the user's computer.[309] AT&T was initially
                  the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.
