                At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the
                 long-anticipated[270] iPhone, a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.
                 [271] The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, for $499 (4 GB) and $599 
                 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract.[272] On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory
                  addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.[273] It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE cellular
                   phone with features found in handheld devices, running a scaled-down version of OS X 
                   (dubbed iPhone OS after the launch and later renamed to iOS), with various Mac OS X applications
                    such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and 
                    Weather. The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi
                     (both "b" and "g").
