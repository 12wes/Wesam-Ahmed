        <p>On October 23, 2001, Apple introduced the iPod digital music player.
             Several updated models have since been introduced, and the iPod brand is now the market leader in
              portable music players by a significant margin. More than 390 million units have shipped as of
               September 2015.[266] Apple has partnered with Nike to offer the Nike+iPod Sports Kit,
                enabling runners to synchronize and monitor their runs with iTunes and the Nike+ website.

            In late July 2017, Apple discontinued its iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle models,
             leaving only the iPod Touch available for purchase.</p>
